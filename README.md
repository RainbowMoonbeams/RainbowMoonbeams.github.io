# Hello!

[Meaghan Rea's Portfolio](https://rainbowmoonbeams.github.io/) is a one page website, laid out for ease of access to information about my education, sillset & recent projects.


## Template

Thanks to [Start Bootstrap](startbootstrap.com), I was able to find a simple theme to layout my online portfolio. I moved some things around, edited the stock images to customize it, changed some colors, and voila! I have a beautiful, seamless portfolio to share.
